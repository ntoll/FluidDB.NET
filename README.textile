The beginnings of an API for interaction with FluidDB for .NET (written in C#).

Not fully tested and definitely a work in progress.

h1. What is FluidDB?

FluidDB is the product of much effort from the "FluidInfo":http://fluidinfo.com/ guys.

Put simply, FluidDB brings the creationist vs evolution argument to the world of databases... ;-)

I've blogged about it a couple of times and these articles include lots of links:

* "http://ntoll.org/article/europython-2009":http://ntoll.org/article/europython-2009
* "http://ntoll.org/article/fluiddb-101":http://ntoll.org/article/fluiddb-101

These are probably good places to start - especially if you follow the links to the documention in the second post referenced above.

As always, feedback, criticism and patches most welcome..!
