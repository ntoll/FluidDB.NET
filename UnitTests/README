Unit Test Setup
===============

In order that the unit tests run correctly you need to supply your username and password credentials.

Rather than hard-code such sensitive data the unit-tests are expecting to find a credentials.json file in your user's temp directory. Something along the lines of:

C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp\credentials.json

This file should look something like this:

{
	"username" : "my_username",
	"password" : "my_password"
}

Where "my_username" and "my_password" are replaced by the appropriate username and password.

You can always use the credentials.json.example as a template for this file.
